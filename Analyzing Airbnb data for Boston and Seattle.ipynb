       "The Roxbury-Dorchester area has historically been a high-crime area and, even though it has improved enough that I am willing to live and host here, I still want my guests to be aware that they should stay vigilant. If you're friendly and avoid being outside after nightfall (especially after most stores close at 8pm), things should be fine. If you suspect you'll feel uncomfortable, I would recommend that--for your peace of mind--you stay in some other part of town. I am leaving it up to my guests to decide for themselves if the risk is worth the thrifty price of the stay. With that said, the overwhelming majority of people are friendly, and I recommend relying on Uber/Lyft instead of public transit for reasons unrelated to safety. The peace of mind is a fringe benefit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         10950\n",

From artsy creative types to high tech. This is a lively and thriving neighborhood not for the faint of heart. There is always something to do, a show to see, a new restaurant to try, or a festival to attend. This is also Seattle's 'gayborhood' - if being surrounded by rainbow hair, glitter & feather boas doesn't sound like your cup of tea this may not be the place for you.

       "West Queen Anne is a hillside sanctuary situated on a hill amazing views at every turn. The guest suite is immediately above an expansive green belt and Queen Anne is a lot of fun to walk or run thanks to a network of century-old staircases.  A few blocks away from the guest suite you’ll find a cafe that serves breakfast, brunch, and lunch and a stellar Turkish coffee shop. There is also an excellent spa immediately adjacent to the cafe.  Lower Queen Anne and Upper Queen Anne are equally near the property. In Upper Queen Anne you’ll find a variety of boutiques and independently owned retail outlets, coffee shops, and restaurants. I’m particularly fond of the restaurant How To Cook a Wolf (dinner from 5-11 p.m. daily) and Via Tribunali (dinner from 5 p.m.). The space is especially close to the Space Needle and Seattle Center, the Museum of Pop Culture, the Pier 91 cruise ship terminal, the Ballard Locks, the Fremont Troll downtown, and more.

       "Smoking of any kind -not allowed inside (including vaping, pot etc)!  There will be  a dedicated can in courtyard to toss your butts.  Seattle is eco-friendly:)  please put garbage/recycling and yard waste in appropriate labeled bins.  Your back-garden loft is situated behind our house and is a 100 foot walk from your parking spot near street to entry. The path is relatively smooth but has a few pavers and a couple evident roots near Cedar tree to be cautious of.  One flight of stairs to loft from courtyard.  Our previous tenants have appreciated the light filled space with skylights that face West so we will continue to have no window coverings. Please bring a sleep mask if you're sensitive to light--though there is no harsh East morning light.  We love our neighbors so please be respectful and keep courtyard sounds to a minimum--especially after 10pm.  Washer/Dryer is european style so dryer takes longer than you might be used to. Manual and instructions will live in studio so please                                            365\n",

Please don't book until we have talked about your dog.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          365\n",

       "I've used my furnishings to set up this Airbnb. It's a great place to be based for a Boston trip, but some reviews I've received are based on an expectation of a 5-star hotel. This Airbnb offers a great value with short travel times into the heart of the city, but it is not a luxury flat; true Airbnb'ers will love it! If you have question about the flat before or after you book please reach out and I will happily answer them. East Boston has a lot of character, and I encourage guests to explore the area around the flat as well as downtown Boston, which is less than 15 minutes away by subway and less than 5 minutes away by car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          365\n",

       "Our HOA is pretty strict.   It REQUIRES us to tell you that:  1- WE do our own background check (we pay for it), so we will ask for a copy of your drivers license or passport for that purpose only.   2- The responsible guest must sign a short term rental agreement to be kept on file in Concierge office during your stay.  Your signature on this document also gives us permission for the background check.  We'll e-mail a copy of the rental agreement to review once you book, but there is free cancellation policy if you’re uncomfortable with anything.  You’ll need to either agree by email or sign and send the contract back within 24 hours of booking.   3- You will need to Check-in at the front office on arrival for ID verification and to pick-up keys.   4-  No parking is provided with this listing. 5-  This unit has a LIMITED VIEW and is in the middle of downtown.

       "If I don't cycle, I personally use UBER/LYFT to get everywhere. UBER/LYFT will save you time and stress, and sometimes even money. The public transit in Boston is ~$2/ride and, in my opinion, frustratingly slow (#spoiledinasia). Even though the triple bus pickup to the Ruggles metro and Dudley bus stations is incredibly convenient, I recommend tourists on a time clock utilize the ride-sharing apps UBER and LYFT. An Uber Pool or Lyft Line to Downtown Crossing only costs $3-$8 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 2 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$8--i.e. the average shared Uber/Lyft ride. An Uber X or private Lyft to Downtown Crossing only costs $8-$15 at off-peak times.  ^ At $2/ride, getting 4 people anywhere on public transit usually costs ~$16--i.e. significantly more than the cost of a private Lyft or Uber X. Unfortunately, UBER/LYFT charge a premium from the airport, so that'll run you ~$20. Even as someone who's pretty ridiculously frugal himself, I have to      9855\n",

The city has also just put in the \"Pronto Bike\" share program making renting bikes easy and cheap with stations all over including one a few blocks from us.

Use of the second room when there are only two or less guests, or bringing extra guests than your original reservation indicated, will trigger the extra guest fee to cover the extra cleaning costs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           365\n",

       "Thank you for following our house rules. * Everything is shiny and new, so for comfort and cleanliness, the house is shoeless.  * We recycle, turn lights off when not in use, etc., and will appreciate if you do the same. Please turn off the electric fireplace when you leave for the day. * For security, when you leave for the day, please lock the windows and door and make sure the yard gate has latched behind you. * Please message us if you wish to invite guests to the property who are not on the reservation. * We provide LED candles for \"mood lighting\" so no fire or flame inside.  * The kitchen is for lighter cooking as the range hood is recirculating, not for cooking with lots of splattering (like frying) or for highly fragrant foods/spices.  * Only toilet paper should be flushed in the toilet and all else (makeup wipes, paper towels, feminine products) should go in the garbage can.

Many of us are Seattle natives, with some Alaskans sprinkled in.  Seattle is beautiful, thanks to Puget Sound, the Olympic and Cascade mountains and all of the terrific scenery that is so close to access.  We love to share our city\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have always hosted friends and family from all over the world.  Travel encourages new ideas, the sharing of cultures and an increased appreciation for how interconnected we all are and how special our world is.  This is why we share our space, energy and friendship. \\r\\n\\r\\nOur family has built a dedicated unit that can offer a place for world travelers and neighborhood friends .  We are excited to extend the offer of friendship and hospitality to those we don’t yet know and give them an opportunity to see Seattle and beyond.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur world will get stronger and healthier by learning and laughing with each other, developing relationships and understanding we all belong to one tribe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             365\n",

       "Hi! My name is Maria Petruccelli, I’m 46, and I’m originally from Brazil. I like to travel, complete puzzles, cook, and go thrifting! I’m very outgoing and will talk your ear off if you let me! I work at tufts health plan center in Watertown part time. I also have a background in cleaning so I keep my house immaculate. I also work for Rover, so I occasionally pet sit dogs, if you are not comfortable with dogs, please let me know and I will make sure not to book any clients during your stay. If I were to pet sit, the dog will be mostly out of your way and not in your personal room, just please let me know what you are comfortable with and I will work with that. I have a daughter who is currently in college so I am becoming a host to make a little extra income. I am looking forward to hosting you!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          365\n",

       "I am a native Seattle-ite and have lived in my home for 10 years.  I love the outdoors and spend lots of time biking, running, skiing, and hiking.  Please feel free to use our bikes, if you would like.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI do have a dog and cat, so allergic people beware.  And have a bee hive in the garden, but they leave people alone.  The dog will be with a dog sitter, but Talullah, our cat would love it if you would let her in and out.  She knows to stay out of the bedrooms at night and has her special blanket in the living room. \\r\\n\\r\\nI hope you enjoy our home.  We love it and think you will too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         365\n",

I am new to airbnb and will be renting out my room when I am away.  My roommate is even friendlier than I am, and is a bartender at a popular restaurant on Capitol Hill.  We live in a great location on the hill, less than 2 miles from downtown, less than 2 miles from Lake Washington, and less than a mile from the 15th Avenue and Broadway strips.  My roommate Craig will leave you to yourself, but is also quite social if your schedules coincide.  We have a washer/dryer in the apartment which you are welcome to use, and you will also have your own bathroom.  You will also be able to get in&out with keys, and not worry about buzzing anyone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               365\n",

       "Hi, I’m Molly! I moved to this amazing city from NC 10 years ago. Didn't know a single person, and now have the best family of friends a gal could ever ask for. A bit about me.. For work, I'm a graphic designer and love what i do. I love the idea of turning something complicated into something simple. I love music. I love to dance to music. I try to start everyday w/ intention. Anything that harbors towards personal growth. I am open minded, yet strong willed. I’m almost always happy. It’s just how i’ve always been. I look up when i walk  and will always smile even if i don’t expect  one back. I believe that if you are a good person, life will be good back to you. I am grateful for each and every experience because I know I’ll never have it ever again. It will be the stories that I take w/ me in the end.
